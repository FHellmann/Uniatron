**Uniatron is the app to spend less time on the phone and more time with exercise!**

At the beginning of a day, each user launches with a set amount of usage time that gradually degrades as apps are used. By achieving activity goals, they can be used to re-enable usage time. Depending on the extent of the activity, a longer or shorter usage time can be unlocked.

Das automatische Sperren von Apps wird den Nutzer dazu animieren mehr sportlich aktiv zu werden und dem allgemeinem Handy Konsum entgegenwirken.

## Features
- [ ] 1. Lock social/fun apps after a certain amount of usage
- [ ] 2. Collect time for doing sportive activity (user can exchange steps for additional screen time)
- [ ] 3. Tracking emotinons after app usage (via questions/smileys)
- [ ] 4. Configurable (at which time do the steps reset daily)
- [ ] 5. Learning aid (locking screen/apps for certain time)

## Schedule
### Milestone 1: First prototype (Due date May 31, 2018)
We will create a first prototype with the basic functionality.

- App locking
- Collect time for doing sportive activity
- Emotion tracking
- Configurations

### Milestone 2: Final app (Due date June 28, 2018)
We will further refined the prototype. This may be implemented further functionalities.

- Learning aid

## Design
Considering the fact that the user can reach every content of the app with three clicks, we opted for a flat navigation hierarchy. With a navigation bar at the bottom with three options (timeline, home, settings) every screen can be reached with just one click. Accordingly, a navigation depth of no more than two clicks can be claimed on each of these pages.

The design of our app complies with the design guidelines of [Google Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html).
